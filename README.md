# Web-Design-Challenge

For this challenge, I created a website to display data analysis assoicated to a previous activity - WeatherPy -  found in this repository: https://github.com/kwajpaige/Web-Design-Challenge.git

The activity seeks to understand the relationship between latitiude and for weather-related variables,  mainly Maximin Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity and Cloudiness. 

As predicted, Latitude and Temperature are directly correlated with higher temperatures associated with cities located near 0 degrees latitude (the equator). Analysis however shows that no such correlation exists between latitude and any of the other 3 variables: Wind Speed, Humidity or Cloudiness.
